Ideas for snapping: 

/*
	checks the distance between two of the objects. if within range, merges them together
  Needs to change how it snaps together, bc as written it looks like it will merge them when they are on top of each other
  Also, idk where to implement this idea
*/

if((Math.abs(objects[0].positionX - objects[1].positionX) < 1000) && (Math.abs(objects[0].positionY - objects[1].positionY) < 1000)) {
                    objects[0].positionX = objects[1].positionY;
                    objects[0].union(objects[1]);
                }
